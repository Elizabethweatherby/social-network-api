# social-network-api

By building a RESTful API, this application lets users in a social networking NoSQL database to perform CRUD operations. We will be using Node.js and Mongoose, to provide a simple way to handle social networking data without the restrictions of relational databases like MySQL. Models include users, friends, thoughts, and reaction data.
